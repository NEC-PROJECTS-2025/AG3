        <h2>Enhanced Classification and Detection of Brain
            Tumor using Hybrid Deep Learning and Machine
            Learning Models</h2>
        <p  style="font-size: 25px; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">This application utilizes advanced machine learning models to classify brain tumors accurately from MRI images.</p>
        <p>
            This tool is designed to assist in the early detection and classification of brain tumors using advanced machine learning techniques.

        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p  style="font-size: 25px; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Explore the details of our project, including the dataset, preprocessing techniques, and the architecture of our hybrid model.</p>
        <p>Our project focuses on using machine learning techniques for the detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI scans. The goal is to automate the process of tumor classification to aid medical professionals in making faster, more accurate diagnoses. Below are the key components of the project, including the dataset, preprocessing techniques, and the architecture of our hybrid CNN-SVM model.</p>
   <h2>dataset</h2>
   <p>The dataset used for training our model consists of a collection of MRI brain scans. These images are critical for identifying various types of brain tumors, and they come from different sources to ensure diversity and generalizability in the model. The dataset includes multiple tumor classes, such as:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Glioma: A common and aggressive form of brain cancer.</li>
    <li>Meningioma: A typically benign tumor that arises from the meninges, the layers of tissue covering the brain and spinal cord.</li>
<li>Pituitary Tumor: Tumors that develop in the pituitary gland, affecting hormone regulation and other bodily functions.</li>
    <li>Non-Tumor Images: Healthy brain tissue used as a reference for comparison.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preprocessing Techniques</h2>
<p>Before feeding the MRI images into the machine learning model, several preprocessing steps are applied to enhance image quality and ensure optimal model performance. Adaptive Gamma Correction (AGC) is used to adjust the contrast of the MRI images, enhancing the visibility of important features, particularly in tumor areas that may have low contrast compared to the surrounding tissue. To reduce noise and smooth the images, median filtering is applied, helping to remove unwanted artifacts that could interfere with the feature extraction process. This ensures that the model can focus on the relevant patterns within the MRI images. Additionally, normalization of pixel intensity values is performed to ensure a consistent range across all images, which is essential for effective model training. This step helps prevent issues that may arise from varying image intensities within the dataset. Lastly, the MRI images are resized to a consistent dimension, making them suitable for processing by the neural network while also reducing computational complexity, thus improving the model's efficiency. Together, these preprocessing techniques ensure that the input images are clean, well-enhanced, and standardized, enabling the model to learn more effectively from the data.</p>
<h2>Model Architecture</h2>
<p>The hybrid model used in this project combines two powerful machine learning techniques: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). This hybrid approach allows the system to leverage both the feature extraction capabilities of CNNs and the classification power of SVMs, creating a robust solution for brain tumor classification.

    The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) acts as the feature extractor in our hybrid model. It consists of several convolutional layers that apply filters to the MRI images, detecting key features such as edges, textures, and patterns associated with different tumor types. As the data progresses through the layers, the CNN learns hierarchical features, from simple edges to more complex structures in the brain images. This enables the model to capture subtle details that are crucial for distinguishing between different types of tumors, enhancing its ability to recognize and classify brain tumors accurately.
    
    Once the CNN extracts relevant features from the MRI images, these features are passed to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. The SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that excels in classification tasks by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points from different classes, such as glioma, meningioma, pituitary, or non-tumor. Using the features extracted by the CNN, the SVM efficiently classifies the MRI images into one of the tumor categories, ensuring precise tumor identification.
    
    This hybrid CNN-SVM architecture leverages the strengths of both methods. The CNN is adept at automatically learning complex patterns from raw image data, while the SVM excels at classification based on these learned features. Together, this combination results in a highly accurate and efficient model for classifying brain tumors from MRI scans.</p>

        <h2>Project Flowchart</h2>
        <p  style="font-size: 25px; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Below is a comprehensive flowchart showcasing the structure and workflow of our brain tumor classification project.</p>
        <p>The workflow begins with preprocessing MRI images to enhance their quality. Techniques like Adaptive Gamma Correction and Adaptive Contrast Enhancement optimize the brightness and contrast of the images, while Median Filtering removes noise. These steps ensure that the images are clean and suitable for further processing.</p>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/flowchart.png') }}" alt="Project Flowchart" style="max-width: 500px; height: auto; margin-top: 20px; border-radius: 10px;">

           <p> After preprocessing, segmentation is conducted using Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering. This technique identifies and isolates the tumor region with high precision by considering the natural fuzziness in data, which makes it more effective than traditional hard classification methods. Following segmentation, features such as texture and spatial relationships are extracted using the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), which provides crucial information for differentiating tumor types.The extracted features are then passed through a CNN to capture deep and intricate patterns from the segmented images. 
            
            The CNN acts as an advanced feature extractor, transforming the data into a format suitable for classification. These features are subsequently fed into an SVM classifier, which categorizes the data into classes such as healthy tissue, benign tumor, or malignant tumor. The SVM’s ability to establish clear decision boundaries enhances the overall classification accuracy of the model.
