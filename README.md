Introduction
Brain tumors are one of the most critical health challenges, often requiring early and accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as manual analysis of MRI scans, can be time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this, our project leverages advanced deep learning techniques—specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) integrated with a Support Vector Machine (SVM)—to automatically detect and classify brain tumors from MRI images.
This approach enhances diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, assisting radiologists in identifying tumors swiftly while minimizing manual intervention. The model is designed to classify MRI scans as tumor or non-tumor, contributing to quicker diagnosis and better treatment planning.
Dataset
The dataset used consists of brain MRI images categorized into tumor and non-tumor classes. It includes various MRI scan types to ensure model robustness and accuracy.
